  <div class="box">No one’s born being good at all things. You become good at things through hard work. You’re not a varsity athlete the
  first time you play a new sport. You don’t hit every note the first time you sing a song.You’ve got to practice. The
  same principle applies to your schoolwork. You might have to do a math problem a few times before you get it right. You
  might have to read something a few times before you understand it.You definitely have to do a few drafts of a paper
  before it’s good enough to hand in.</div>
